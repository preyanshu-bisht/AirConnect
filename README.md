SKYHACK 2.0 HACKATHON

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to improve call center efficiency by classifying the primary reasons for customer inquiries. Using data from United Airlinesâ€™ call center, the model identifies the most frequent call reasons and groups less common ones, simplifying the classification process. By applying the XGBoost algorithm, the project aims to accurately predict call reasons, leading to better resource allocation and optimized key metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The insights gained can streamline operations, improve customer service, and guide future automation efforts.
